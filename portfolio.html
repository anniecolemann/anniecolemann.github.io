         <h3>late nights. | video | 2019</h3>
         <p>"Late nights" For my piece I focused on the bright colored street lights and sounds that came from a night drive. I boosted the color saturation and blurred the focus in and out of clips. I used glitch for my transitions and effects, while distorted some of the sound so that it was almost like static.</p>

       <h3> tripping at the bridge | composite | 2019</h3>
       <p>Our group decided on doing different monuments of San Francisco. Our series is called SF and features three images all 8x8 inches. My image was originally a picture of the Golden Gate Bridge. My wanted the vibe to be very trippy and kind of confuse the person looking at it. For the sky I put the newspaper talking about the infamous earthquake, along with my dog Coco in the sand with various other clips.</p>
